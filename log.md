# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML for my FCC Landing Page Project.

**Thoughts:** I had a 2 week break instead of a 2 day break from my streak, but I've decided not to start again as I don't think my journey ended. I needed some time away from the computer screen, and attending the Tech Talent 2019 (Newcastle) Careers Fair gave me the spark that I needed to get back into coding.

On the bright side, creating the HTML structure for my project felt a lot easier than it did two weeks ago. Sometimes you just need to let the knowledge sink in!
