# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: May 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the HTML for my FCC Landing Page Project.

**Thoughts:** I had a 2 week break instead of a 2 day break from my streak, but I've decided not to start again as I don't think my journey ended. I needed some time away from the computer screen, and attending the Tech Talent 2019 (Newcastle) Careers Fair gave me the spark that I needed to get back into coding.

On the bright side, creating the HTML structure for my project felt a lot easier than it did two weeks ago. Sometimes you just need to let the knowledge sink in!

### Day 19: May 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Familiarised myself with GitHub and made some notes on how to write CSS so it's written mobile-first.

**Thoughts:** The HTML side of thing now comes more intuitively to me, but the CSS side not so much. It feels like it should be a relatively easy language, but then translating ideas into design isn't always the case. I'm going to explore more tomorrow when I have more mental energy for it.
